// What are the benefits of JSX:
1. JavaScript XML
2. We can write easily HTML code in JS through JSX
3. We can also use JS expression in HTML code through JSX
4. We can use together Markup language & logic in same file, for that We use React Component 

*/

/* 
// What are components?
=> 1. Components are the building blocks of any React App and a typical React App will have many of these.
2. Components let you split the UI into independent to reusable pieces, and think about the each piece in isolation.
3. We call such components 'functional components' because they are litrelly JavaScript functions.

/* 
What is React JS?
1. ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. ReactJS is declarative, efficient, and flexible
3. It is fast & component-based.
4. It was initially developed and maintained by facebook.
5. React breaks web elements down into reusable components making manage complex web interfaces.
6. React's Virtual DOM is a JavaScripts representation of the actual DOM.

/* 
//  components at 3 stage of React:
1. Mounting
2. Update
3. Unmounting
*/
/* 
// Mounting:
1. Constructor()
2. getDerivedStateFromProps()
3. render()
4. componentDidMount()
*/
/* 
// Updating:
1. getDrivedStateFromProps()
2. shouldComponentUpdate()
3. render()
4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
5. componentDidUpdate()

*/

/* 
// UnMounting: When need to remove a component from DOM.
1. componentWillMount()

*/

/* 
// What is JSX? 
1. JavaScript XML
2. JSX is a syntax extension for React JS
3. Easier to read & write
4. Gets transpiled to JavaScript with Bibel.
5. 'class' attribute becomes 'className'
6. Properties are written in camelCase
7. onclick -> onClick, tabindex -> tabIndex
8. Tags must be closed: <h1></h1>, <img/>
